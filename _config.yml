  My name is Jordan Kasper I am currently a Senior Support Engineer at ForgeRock and am looking to move into the Data Science/Engineering space. \n
  
  I enjoy the work I do now but I have always felt like there was something missing. When I came across an article talking 
  about careers in Data Science. I wasnâ€™t quite sure what it all entailed but I had heard the buzz word thrown around 
  a lot so I figured it was worth a read.\n
  \n
  Well one article turned into about 15 and by the end I was pretty sure I knew what I wanted to do for the foreseeable 
  future, I was hooked. What it came down to for me was the data. I love being able to see a bunch of information and 
  try to make some sense of it and even better yet I get to develop and build systems to help with it!\n
  \n
  I have a huge interest in how the data is stored and managed and what the systems look like that do this. I feel drawn 
  to the engineering side as I still love to program and this hopefully will give a good balance of both worlds.
